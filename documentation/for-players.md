For start the modification, you need installed Forge, it is desirable that the version matches the supported versions. You can download Forge from the [link](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.14.4.html).
Move the downloaded mod (marked `-MOD` in the file name) to the `mods` folder (installation example below).

```

└── ...
```

Now try to start the game, go to the `mods` tab, if this modification is displayed in the `mods` tab, then the mod has been successfully installed.
